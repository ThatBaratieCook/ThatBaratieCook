# [AxolotlPlus](https://github.com/ThatBaratieCook/AxolotlPlus) will be using [Compliance](https://compliancepack.net/) from now on.

There's a lot of reasons why AxolotlPlus will use compliance, and most of them are because of the events that happened with Faithful. To simply introduce the problem, faithful was stolen from Vattic (the original creator), if so it would be wrong to support / use a stolen resource.




## Why Compliance?

The reason that AxolotlPlus will be using compliance is because it is similar to faithful, as it does increase the resolution of the default 16x16 textures. It has the same goal and has a favorable style, because of this there isn't a bad reason to stop using and supporting faithful. There is other projects also supported by Vattic that do the same thing, like [FaithfulVenom](https://antvenom.com/files) and [EmulatedVattic](https://github.com/emulatedvattic), so why didn't I use these ones instead? It's quite simple, I prefer compliance more and I'm  pretty sure the majority of people also do.


## Is it Necessary?
Not really, but it is more ethical and supporting a stolen resource is wrong. If news broke out before making this project I would have used compliance or anything different than faithful anyway, it doesn't matter if it's not necessary. It's like if you say it's not necessary to add more textures as it does its purpose, it seems pretty obvious that analogy is wrong, so the further use of compliance is fine.

## What does this mean for AxolotlPlus?

Well, nothing really. The only thing that changes to using compliance is just changing the textures used. Honestly they look quite similar, and if so there shouldn't be any problem with visuals especially because both textures' purpose are the same and the execution is somewhat similar. 

Hope this clarifies :)
